Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Gowtham Gopalakrishnan and I currently work as Staff Systems Engineer at [Freshworks](https://freshworks.com). I'm planning to write here regularly about the things I learn along the way. Check out the [TIL](/til/) or the [blog](/blog/) entries.

Apart from work, I wander around servers most of the time. I try to [self-host](/blog/self-hosting/) most of the software I use. I do occasionally [contribute](https://github.com/gowthamgts) to open-source projects.

I also love playing RTS and castle-simulation games ([Anno 1800](https://store.steampowered.com/app/916440/Anno_1800/), [Cities Skylines](https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines/about), [Stronghold Crusader 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/232890/Stronghold_Crusader_2), [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com), etc). I also do lan party and play Call of Duty with an online friend, whom I met about 5 years ago.
